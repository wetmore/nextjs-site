title: About
---


I am a software developer who, like many in my generation, was exposed to
programming through [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) as a
young teenager. The first lines of code I ever wrote powered the pause and play
buttons for my animations; soon after, I realized I was more interested in
creating interactions for my animations than I was animating anything. Over the
next few years, I steadily taught myself how to code in order to create games
and visual toys with Flash and [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)).

In 2010 I left the suburbs to attend McGill University, which was a wonderful
excuse to live in Montreal for five years. Living in Montreal shaped me into the
person I am today, and I will forever love the city for it. While I started
university with the intention of leaving as a software developer (which is what
ended up happening), I fell in love with math in my third year of school and
switched into the Math/Computer Science major starting in my fourth. This meant spending an
extra year at McGill, and I was more than happy to oblige. Spending time
studying math and computer science theory while surrounded by people who shared the same
passion was a true highlight of my life so far. While I don't do much math
these days, the general clarity of thought and beauty of argumentation present
in the subject had a big influence on my approach to problem solving. I still
look back on my time at McGill fondly and love to visit Montreal when possible.

In 2015 I graduated from McGill and entered the real world as a software engineer
at Google in New York City, working on the search frontend. Around the same time
I started working, I started rock climbing, which quickly became the biggest
passion of my life since I started programming as a kid. After working at Google
for a few years, I left to convert a cargo van into a mobile home and travel
North America. Once the van was complete, I devoted myself to developing my climbing
skills, and climbed in many places I'd dreamt of visiting, including Yosemite
and Joshua Tree in California, El Potrero Chico in Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico, and
Squamish in British Columbia, Canada.

After a year and a half on the road, I started to miss programming and the
feeling of building something. In early 2020, I wrapped up the nomad chapter of
my life and returned to software development, re-energized and excited to create
again.
