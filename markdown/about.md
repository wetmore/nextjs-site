title: About
---

I am a software developer who, like many in my generation, was exposed to
programming through [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) as a
teenager. The first lines of code I ever wrote powered the pause and play
buttons for my animations; soon after, I realized I was more interested in
creating interactions for my animations than I was in animating anything. Over
the next few years, I steadily taught myself how to code in order to create
games and visual toys with Flash and [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)).

In 2010 I left my hometown of Philadelpia to attend McGill University, which was
a wonderful excuse to live in Montreal for five years. Living in Montreal shaped
me into the person I am today, and I will forever love the city for it. While I
started university with the intention of leaving as a software developer (which
is what ultimately happened), I fell in love with math in my third year of
school and switched into a Math/Computer Science joint major in my fourth. This
meant spending an extra year at McGill, and I was more than happy to oblige.
While I don't do much math these days, the general clarity of thought and beauty
of argumentation present in the subject had a big influence on my approach to
problem solving.

In 2015 I graduated from McGill and entered the "real" world as a software engineer
at Google in New York City, working on the search frontend. As I settled into
work life, I began rock climbing and fell in love with the sport. After working
at Google for a few years, I left to convert a cargo van into a mobile home and
travel North America. In that time, I devoted myself to developing my climbing
skills, and climbed in places like Yosemite and Joshua Tree National Parks in
California, El Potrero Chico in Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico, and Squamish in British
Columbia, Canada.

After a year and a half on the road, I started to miss programming and the
feeling of building something. In early 2020, I wrapped up the nomadic chapter of
my life and returned to software development, re-energized and excited to create
again.
