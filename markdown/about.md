### Early life and college

I was born and raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia and enjoyed a childhood
spent exploring the neighborhood, climbing trees, and playing flight sims. I was
fortunate to have parents who loved to travel, who brought me on trips to places
such as Australia, Europe, and British Columbia. Many of these trips involved
road trips in camper vans, which no doubt played an influential role later in
my life. As I moved through my teenage years, I started spending more time
indoors as I became more interested in computers and programming, but a love of
the outdoors always stayed with me. When I graduated high school, three friends
and I piled into a minivan and pointed it west, pulling into Rocky Mountain
National Park 3 or 4 days later after our first exposure to the enormity of the
American expanse. This trip ended up sticking with me as one of the foundational
events of my life, and inspired many future road trips.

In 2010 I left the suburbs to attend McGill University, which was a wonderful
excuse to live in Montreal for 5 years. Living in Montreal shaped me into the
person I am today, and I will forever love the city for it. While I started
university with the intention of leaving as a software developer (which is what
ended up happening), I fell in love with math in my third year of school and
switched into the Math/CS major starting in my fourth. This meant spending an
extra year at McGill, and I was more than happy to oblige. Spending time
studying math and CS theory while surrounded by people who shared the same
passion was a true highlight of my life so far. While I don't do much math
these days, the general clarity of thought and beauty of argumentation present
in the subject had a big influence on my approach to problem solving. I still
look back on my time at McGill fondly and love to visit Montreal when possible.

In 2015 I graduated from McGill and left Montreal to take a job at Google in NYC.
In between leaving Montreal and moving to New York, I traveled to Asia for the
first time, and drove from Seattle to Las Vegas with a friend. This trip took
us down the Pacific Coast and through the Sierra Nevada range, and included our
first experiences in Yosemite National Park and Joshua Tree National Park. This
was another hugely influential trip in my life, because it pushed me into the
biggest passion in my life since programming -- rock climbing. After seeing
climbers in Yosemite and Joshua Tree, my friend and I made a pact to start
climbing, and when I started working in New York later that year I started going
to the climbing gym.

### Climbing and vanlife

Climbing quickly took over the majority of my spare time and mental energy as I
settled into life as a software engineer. Going sport climbing outdoors for the
first time really solidified the passion for me, and at the time I felt like
rock climbing really was the perfect outdoor activity I never knew I was looking
for. Cheap plane tickets lead to a sport climbing trip in Spain soon afterwards,
during which I was so focused on the climbing that I almost missed the cultural
experience. A few months later a friend and I split the cost of a trad rack and
started figuring out how to place gear at the Gunks near NYC, the beginning of a
deep love for trad climbing and the Gunks. Soon I was going to the Gunks every
weekend possible and spending a lot of time and scheming up trips to new places.

After a few years of spending the majority of my weeks indoors and on a computer,
punctuated by truly life-altering experiences on weekends and longer climbing
trips, I decided I would only be young once (YOLO) and decided to take a break
from working to spend more time climbing. In the spring of 2018 I left my job
at Google and spent the summer converting a Ford Transit cargo van into a camper
van. Building the van was a great introduction to the realities of building
something physical (made of more than just bits). In September 2018, I ran into
my self-imposed deadline head first and headed west before being able to apply
a final layer of polish to the van, something which bothered me for maybe 3 days
before I realized that just having a van I could live out of at all was amazing.

I spent about a year and half living on the road, climbing to my heart's content,
and meeting a lot of cool people who were following the same dream. I finally
got to climb in Yosemite and Joshua Tree, the places that had kicked off my love
for climbing in the first place, and learned to pursue goals that seemed beyond
my abilities. I climbed perfect splitters and got up to no good with a group
of dirtbags in Squamish, did my first big wall in Yosemite, and climbed a remote
dome of granite in Idaho. I topped out Epinephrine in Red Rocks before noon, and
discovered the importance of post-climb margaritas and tacos in El Potrero Chico.
In all, I had an amazing time just going where the road took me, and for the first
time in my life I felt like I was living life off of the low-risk rails I'd been
set on since birth (go to school, go to college, work at a big company).

### The present

Near the end of the experience, I started to miss programming and the feeling of
building something again. I missed my friends back in New York, and felt bad
being absent while they went through major milestones in their lives. While I
loved the freedom of the nomad climbing lifestyle, I started to pine for a bit
more stability. I made a plan to move back to New York and settle down in the
late spring of 2020, after ticking off a few more personal climbing goals, but
as we all learned in March of 2020, the best laid plans of mice and men often go
astray, and my trip was cut short by the pandemic.

I'm sad the trip ended so abruptly, and that in our new reality I am not able to
climb much anymore, or go on spontaneous trips. For the first time in years,
however, I am genuinely excited about programming again, and I've been able to
devote my time to learning more and building software. I look forwards to where
the future takes me, and where I take my future.
