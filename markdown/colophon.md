title: About this website
---

This website was created using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The previous iteration
of the site was built with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) as an exercise
in building something with Haskell in 2015. Ultimately I decided to rewrite the
site with next.js as a way to learn something new, and because javascript has
a richer ecosystem of libraries to lean upon when making the website the way I
would like it to be.

The header uses the font [Playfair Display](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/playfair-display),
using the small capitals variation, and the rest of the text on the website is
typeset with [Sorts Mill Goudy](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/sorts-mill-goudy).
Sorts Mill Goudy was chosen back in 2015, but I updated the header from [Nevis](https://www.fontspace.com/nevis-font-f14902)
because the angular style no longer appealed to me.

The typography on this website is based on a [tritonic scale](http://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/);
the base font size $f_0$ is $18$pt, and every other font size on this website is a
multiple of this base -- $f_0 2^{\frac{i}{3}}$ for some integer $i$. I chose this
scale for its simplicity.

Latex support is provided by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and markdown is parsed
with [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it). 

The bird image was pulled from [this clipart](http://clipart-library.com/clipart/M8iAE6yca.htm).
I chose the bird because I've always daydreamed of soaring above the clouds and
been fascinated by flocks of birds.
